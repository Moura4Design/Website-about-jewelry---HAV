Project Overview: This website was developed during my time as a freelance developer. It is an e-commerce platform focused on jewelry, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and Node.js. The site includes:
A Home Page featuring a dynamic slideshow showcasing key products.
A Collection Page displaying a curated gallery of jewelry pieces.
A Product Page with detailed images and a fully functional shopping cart, allowing users to add or remove items.
A Contact Page with a user-friendly contact form, enabling visitors to easily get in touch for inquiries or custom orders.
The website was created entirely from scratch, without using any templates, giving it a fully custom and unique design. The project is nearly complete only the payment integration method remains to be implemented.

Technologies Used in Node.js:
Node.js:  Used as the runtime environment for building the server-side logic and handling backend functionality.
Express: A lightweight web framework used to manage routing, serve static files, and handle HTTP requests and responses.

Front-End Technologies:
HTML: Used to structure the website pages and forms, and includes a slide show feature.
CSS: Provides the styling and layout for the pages.
JavaScript: Implements a basic image slideshow with "Previous" and "Next" navigation buttons. A functional shopping cart that allows users to add and remove items dynamically.
